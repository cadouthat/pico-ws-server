# pico-ws-server
WebSockets server implementation for Raspberry Pi Pico W on top of raw lwIP

## HTTP Notes
This does not aim to be a general-purpose HTTP server, and only includes minimal HTTP support for the WebSocket handshake. Only `GET / HTTP/1.1` requests are allowed, all other requests will return status `400`/`404`/`405`.

Valid requests which do not request a WebSocket upgrade will be served a static HTML blob. This is defined at compile time via CMake, using `PICO_WS_SERVER_STATIC_HTML`.

## Performance Notes
No benchmarking has been done, but this server is expected to have a small memory footprint and low response latency. However, there is likely room for performance improvement when it comes to processing large payloads.

Some low hanging fruit for future improvement:
* Process payload bytes in bulk
* Provide interface to consume chunked messages, without copying into a continuous buffer
